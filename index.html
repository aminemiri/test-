            Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccitini was born on June 24, 1987in Rosario
    
            , a working-class city in the northeast of Argentina .
    
            Third child of Jorge Horacio Messi, worker in a manufacturing plant,
    
             and Célia Maria Cuccitini, part-time housekeeper , 
    
            he has two older brothers, Rodrigo and Matias, and a little sister, María Sol . 
    
       He has Catalan and Italian origins  : Ramon Pérez Llobera, one of his ancestors, comes from El Poal , 
    
     a municipality in the province of Lleida in Catalonia , 
     while one of his great-grandfathers lived in the city of ' Ancona in Italy, 
    
     From where he emigrated to Argentina in the xix th  century . 
    
     He therefore has Italian nationality and is registered on the electoral rolls of Recanati. 
    
      His godfather Claudio Biancucchi is the father of three professional footballers:  
      Maxi , Emmanuel and Bruno Biancucchi.
    
       Bojan Krkić , who will be his teammate at FC Barcelona from 2007 to 2011 , 
    
       is also a cousin to the fourth generation .
    
    When he was born, his family resided in Las Heras , 
    
   a poor suburb in the province of Mendoza , south of Rosario,  
    in a cottage on the edge of a narrow road . He is a particularly shy child and not very talkative, 
    
   to the point that his primary school teacher advises his parents to go see a child psychiatrist  
    
     to remedy this.
    
    An introvert and little interested in his studies, Messi “transforms” , according to his father,
    
   when he plays football . “As soon as he played on a field or in the street, 
    
     he was no longer the same. At home, he did not speak but with a ball, he looked like he was singing 14 . 
    
   " His father is a coach and two brothers playing in the Grandoli local club. 
    
   In 1991, a club coach, Salvador Aparicio,  
    
  offered him to join a game between two teams of five-year-old players, although he was a year younger. 
    
     His mother declines, arguing that he is too small and risks hurting himself with the older ones,< 
    
     but his grandmother urges him to go. Aparicio says:“The first ball passed him beside, on his right, 
    
     without him reacting. But the second landed directly on his good leg, the left.  
    
   There, after a check, he left by dribbling a player, then two, three ... 
    
    I was afraid that the others would hurt him. So I was shouting: shoot, shoot, shoot! 
    
    But he continued without stopping.  
    
    I've never seen that. I said to myself: this one, I don't take it out of the team anymore. 
    
     And I never took it out again .
    
    Célia, her grandmother, encourages her and takes her to training. Messi describes a close relationship: 
    
     “I miss her so much. I so wanted her to see what I have become.  
    
    >It is for this reason that I dedicate my goals to her,
    
     because I like to tell myself that she sees me from where she is. ”   .
    
     Messi remains for three years at his club. The whole neighborhood comes to see him play .  
    
    Subsequently, Messi played a few games with Central Córdoba , another Rosario club .
    
    despite his health problem he never give up .
